  Among the eateries revitalising San Francisco's once-gritty Mid-Market
  neighborhood into the city's most buzzy food and drinks corridor is Bon
  Marché, a sunny Californian take on Le Marais. This 7500-square-foot space
  combines a café, a brewery, an oyster bar, a full-service restaurant, and even
  a flower shop that doubles as a stage for live jazz at night.
